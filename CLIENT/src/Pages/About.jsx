                    Hello! I'm <span className="text-indigo-400 font-semibold">Saunak Chaudhary</span>, a passionate MERN Stack Developer and MSc IT student based in Anand. I love building full-stack web applications that solve real-world problems, and I'm always seeking new challenges to grow as a developer.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    My journey started with a Bachelor's in CA & IT, where I not only excelled academically with a 9.66 CGPA but also actively participated in hackathons, winning multiple tech competitions. Whether it's front-end design or back-end logic, I enjoy crafting seamless and efficient user experiences.
                    I thrive in collaborative environments and love connecting with like-minded tech enthusiasts.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    In my free time, you'll find me solving DSA problems, playing chess, or diving into the latest JavaScript frameworks. I'm always up for learning something new and pushing boundaries!
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    I'm skilled in technologies like <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and more. I'm also proficient in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and Git. I'm constantly improving my understanding of data structures and algorithms to write better code every day.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    Apart from academics and projects, I&apos;ve taken part in numerous coding competitions and group projects, where I&apos;ve honed both my technical and soft skills. I believe communication, creativity, and consistency are just as important as coding skills.
                </p>
